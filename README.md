<img src="https://github.com/arshpreet8051/CRUD_in_CI/assets/99662930/3e367e9a-e677-4dc3-9adf-f01dbba42d8c" alt="image" width="550"/>

In the context of CodeIgniter, a PHP web application framework, CRUD operations are fundamental for database interactions.

**Create**: Inserting a new user into the 'users' table.

**Read**: Retrieving all products from the 'products' table.

**Update**: Updating the status of an order in the 'orders' table.

**Delete**: Deleting a comment from the 'comments' table.

CodeIgniter's database library provides convenient methods for performing these operations, simplifying the implementation of CRUD functionality in web applications.

# CodeIgniter 4 Framework

## What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible and secure.
More information can be found at the [official site](https://codeigniter.com).

This repository holds the distributable version of the framework.
It has been built from the
[development repository](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4).

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [CodeIgniter 4](https://forum.codeigniter.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=28) on the forums.

The user guide corresponding to the latest version of the framework can be found
[here](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/).

## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!

## Repository Management

We use GitHub issues, in our main repository, to track **BUGS** and to track approved **DEVELOPMENT** work packages.
We use our [forum](http://forum.codeigniter.com) to provide SUPPORT and to discuss
FEATURE REQUESTS.

This repository is a "distribution" one, built by our release preparation script.
Problems with it can be raised on our forum, or as issues in the main repository.
